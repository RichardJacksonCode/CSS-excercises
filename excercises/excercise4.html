        <h1>TO DO:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Make the element with both the avatar and proportioned classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).</li>
                <li>Make the element with both the avatar and distorted classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).</li>
            </ul>
    </body>
